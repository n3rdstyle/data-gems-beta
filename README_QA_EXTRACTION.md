## Extraction Process

1. **Initial PDF Reading** - Attempted direct text extraction (failed - image-based PDF)
2. **OCR Installation** - Installed required tools:
   - pypdf (Python PDF library)
   - pdf2image (PDF to image conversion)
   - pytesseract (OCR wrapper)
   - poppler (PDF processing utilities)
3. **OCR Processing** - Converted all 49 pages to images and performed OCR
4. **Pattern Matching** - Extracted Q&A pairs using regex patterns:
   - Pattern: `Frage [number]:` followed by question text and answer
5. **Cleaning** - Removed OCR artifacts and noise patterns

## Notes

### OCR Quality
- The PDF was a screen capture (44.4MB), making OCR necessary
- Some OCR errors remain in the answers (e.g., "Koaatnips" instead of "Roadtrips")
- Common artifacts like "AbV4LE", "OGVEE" were removed where possible
- German text with umlauts (ä, ö, ü) mostly preserved correctly

### Question Numbering
- Original conversation had 250 questions planned
- Extracted 186 questions with recognizable patterns
- Some questions appear twice with same number (conversation had restarts)
- Question numbers range from 1-200 (not all sequential)

### Content
- Mix of personal preference questions (food, travel, hobbies)
- Deep reflection questions (identity, values, relationships)
